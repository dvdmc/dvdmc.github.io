  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="prose-slate">
    I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics, Robotics, and Mechatronics
    Engineering from the University of Malaga (2020), and a Master's degree in
    Robotics, Graphics, and Computer Vision from the University of Zaragoza
    (2022). Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Computer
    Science and Systems Engineering at the University of Zaragoza, supported by
    a national FPU grant. My research focuses on active perception, semantic
    scene understanding, drone control, and multi-robot collaboration.
